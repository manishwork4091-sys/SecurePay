## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#2146C7) to convey trust, security, and stability, aligning with the financial security theme.
- Background color: Light blue (#E6EEFF), a very desaturated tint of the primary hue, for a clean and professional look.
- Accent color: Vivid cyan (#00FFFF), an analogous color that provides excellent contrast for highlighting important actions and alerts.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines; Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body. 'Space Grotesk' will be used for headlines to provide a computerized, techy feel and 'Inter' for the body in order to assure that long amounts of text is easy to read.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
- Utilize minimalist, line-based icons to represent different transaction types, security features, and risk levels.
- Maintain a clean, card-based layout with clear information hierarchy and responsive design for different screen sizes.
